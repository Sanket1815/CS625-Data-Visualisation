The push command in Git is used to send local changes that we have made to a our repository

If I have committed a change in my machine and if I want to revert the changes then I will use git reset command.

- Data visualization is the practice of converting data into a graphical or visual representation, making complex information more accessible and understandable.
- This process involves transforming numerical, textual, or raw data into a visual context, such as charts, graphs, maps, and other visual formats.
- Data is displayed in a visual format, such as bar graphs, line charts, pie charts, scatter plots, heat maps, and more.

**Node.js has revolutionized the way developers build web applications, especially when it comes to creating scalable, real-time applications**. _Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture allows for efficient performance_.
**_For instance, a simple server in Node.js can be set up with just a few lines of code:_**

```javascript
const http = require('http');
   http.createServer((req, res) => { res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
   res.end('Hello World\n'); }).listen(3000);.
```

This simplicity and power have contributed to Node.js's widespread popularity. For more information and tutorials, visit [Node.js's official website](https://nodejs.org/en)

# Data Visualization

## Why Data Visualization

### Methods of Data Visualization

## Tableau

## Google Colab

## Python/Seaborn

![Plot1](/assests/images/plot1.png)
Here in the above image, we are calling a function to create a plot for penguins database. And we are setting the x axis as bill_length_mm column and y axis as bill_length_mm column. and in the add function so.Dot() represents the dots in the scatter plot.

![Plot2](/assests/images/plot2.png)
In the above image, we are calling a function to create a plot for penguins database, we are setting the x-axis as species column and y-axis as body_mass_g column and also we are differentiating between male and female penguins using color. In the add function so.bar indicates that it is a bar chart, so.Agg() we are calculating mean, median and mode, so.Dodge() indicates bar charts is used to place bars next to each other rather than stacking them.

If we remove the outer parentheses it will give Syntax error.

## Observable and Vega-Lite

When we replace markCircle() with markSquare(), it changes the data points that were marked in circle to sqaure.

When we replace markCircle() with markPoint(), it changes the data points that were marked in circle to any shape but here it is changes to hollow circle.

For swapping x and y axes, we just need to interchange the fields used for x axis and y axis.

![Bar Chart](/assests/images/bar.png)

Because we have commented out the y axis, so it will only show x axis plot.
