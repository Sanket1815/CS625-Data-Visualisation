- Data visualization is the practice of converting data into a graphical or visual representation, making complex information more accessible and understandable.
- This process involves transforming numerical, textual, or raw data into a visual context, such as charts, graphs, maps, and other visual formats.
- Data is displayed in a visual format, such as bar graphs, line charts, pie charts, scatter plots, heat maps, and more.

**Node.js has revolutionized the way developers build web applications, especially when it comes to creating scalable, real-time applications**. _Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture allows for efficient performance_.
**_For instance, a simple server in Node.js can be set up with just a few lines of code:_**

```javascript
const http = require('http');
   http.createServer((req, res) => { res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
   res.end('Hello World\n'); }).listen(3000);.
```

This simplicity and power have contributed to Node.js's widespread popularity. For more information and tutorials, visit [Node.js's official website](https://nodejs.org/en)
